/**
 *  The SyncMediator is an intermediate layer between the UnionSync
 *  implementation and the CatalogHandler.
 *  It's main responsibility is to unwind file system intrinsics as
 *  deleting all files in a deleted directory. Furthermore newly
 *  created directories are recursed and all included files are
 *  added as a whole. (Performance improvement)
 *
 *  Furthermore it keeps track of hard link relations. CVMFS defines
 *  hard links as files with the same inode pointing to the same
 *  chunk of data. As we cannot determine an appropriate inode number
 *  while synching, we just keep track of hard link relations itself.
 *  Inodes will be assigned at run time of the CVMFS client according
 *  to these relations.
 *
 *  Another responsibility of this class is the creation and destruction
 *  of nested catalogs. If a .cvmfscatalog magic file is encountered,
 *  either on delete or add, it will be treated as nested catalog change.
 *
 *  DirEntries containing data (e.g. not Directories or symlinks) will
 *  be accumulated and it's contents are compressed at the end of the
 *  synching process en bloc. This gives us the ability to do this
 *  computational intensive task concurrently at the end of the sync
 *  process.
