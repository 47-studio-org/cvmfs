/**
 *  This file defines classes to abstract information retrieval from
 *  union file system components.
 *  
 *  Here you have a class UnionSync which is the base class for all
 *  supported union file systems and provides some basic principals.
 *  UnionSync is meant to be a singleton.
 *
 *  Furthermore there is a concrete implementation of UnionSync called
 *  SyncAufs, which is capable of abstracting all AUFS 1.x specifics
 *  to sync CVMFS by the help of AUFS.
 *
 *  There are three main things, an union file system has to do:
 *    1. Copy on Write
 *       read-only files in CVMFS will be copied up to an overlay
 *       volume on write access.
 *    2. Whiteout
 *       the union file system has to mark files as deleted, if you
 *       remove them from a read only file system
 *    3. Opaque Directories
 *       if you delete an entire directory from the read only file
 *       system and recreate it empty afterwards the union file system
 *       has to mark this directory as opaque to hide all old contents
 *
 *  Furthermore the union file system could create special files
 *  which we don't care about.
 *
 *  All these intrinsics are encapsulated and handled be the classes in
 *  this file.
