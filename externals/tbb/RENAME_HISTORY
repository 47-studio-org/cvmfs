We repackage the original tgz downloaded from threadingbuildingblocks.org
into a fresh tar.gz archive using the following commands:

TBB_VERSION=4.1-4 # <-- ADAPT THIS
tar xzf <original tgz file>
mv <resulting directory> tbb-${TBB_VERSION}
tar czf tbb-${TBB_VERSION}.tar.gz tbb-${TBB_VERSION}



Here you have a mapping to the original archive names:

Original Name                   Repackaged Archive        TBB Version
tbb41_20130613oss_src.tgz       tbb-4.1-4.tar.gz          4.1 Update 4
