# How to Contribute Code to CernVM-FS

We welcome code contributions!  

If you are about to develop a bug fix or a new feature, it could be helpful to let us know about it beforehand, for instance on the cvmfs-devel@cern.ch mailing list or by private mail or through our [ticket tracker](https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CVM).  This can avoid duplicated work and allows us to coordinate the developemnt.
